Hello! My name is **Victor Augusteo**. 

I make mobile and web apps. Currently I am working in Australia crafting gaming app for iOS with Swift.

# Contact
The fastest way to contact me would be through email: [augusteo@gmail.com][2]. Typically I will respond in 24 hours.

My [LinkedIn][3] page contains my updated employment status and it has nice history, so I would recommend checking that out. 
Please send me a connection request if you use LinkedIn too.

You can check out some of the fun projects I did on [Github][4], but most of the stuff on my job would be in private repos. I plan to put more stuff on that page, so stay tuned!

# Tech Experience
I have worked with many technology stack throughout the years including:

- iOS with Swift and ObjC
- Web apps with Ruby on Rails, Angular, React, Elixir & Phoenix, etc.
- Android with Java
- Brief encounter with Xamarin and C#.Net
- C and C++ at uni
- Running servers with Apache and NginX on Linux
- MongoDB, Postgresql, MySQL
- AWS stacks i.e. EC2, S3, SNS, Cognito, EBS, etc.

Currently I'm really enjoying doing Swift full time. It is probably my favourite language of all time despite all the quirks.

I am also co-hosting the [Melbourne Mobile Meetup][5]. We run a monthly meetups with awesome speaker lineup about the wider mobile tech world. 

# Public Speaking
Since university years, I've really enjoyed giving talks about various topics. 

Back then, I lectured classes of up to a hundred students about photography.

Nowadays I mostly stick to giving talks about tech.

The latest talks I presented:

- [Software Craftsmanship][crafts]
- [Streamlining API with Swagger.io][swagger]

# Shipped Products
Coming soon!
